        <p>Our story is something unique, crazy and fun, just like us. We met when we were 15 in 2006. Martin was my first boyfriend; I was head over heels for him. Even though he was extremely skinny and not seeming my type at all, I loved his personality more than anything. Our Spanish teacher takes full credit of our relationship because that is where we began our crazy awesome journey. 
	</p>
	<p>
Through the years we were on and off, we went through a bad breakup in 2007 but months later were still talking. There was never a time when we were not in contact with each other, whether it be a text here and there or a secret "date". We dated other people but there was something that always drew me to him. I was more of the non-committed, free spirited girl. He was the one who was constantly chasing me, which is how it should always be, right? 
</p> 
	<p>
We were always there for each other, always. Him more so for me than I for him, I never realized that until now. He has helped me so much through my life trials. He has stuck around even though I was the one constantly fighting and leaving.  
</p>
	<p>
The reason for the "Doctor Who" theme is because Martin and I love this television show; it was something that we bonded over. We would watch this show for hours on end and talk about the infamous time traveler and religiously watch new episodes. This show brought us together on a level that I did not expect. I've never been the lovey commitment type, and he was. I never wanted to get married and he did. For some odd reason this show changed that for me, the way we would talk about it and plan to watch it and have in depth conversations on how time travel is just a bunch of "wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff". Because of the type of love that The Doctor would have with his companions (sidekicks) it made me realize that Martin is my Doctor and I am his companion, we are inseparable. 
</p>
	<p>
This crazy boy tells me at the beginning of 2013 that I would be engaged within the year. I laughed at him and shrugged it off. March came and went, August came and went October came and went (yet I slightly ruined that engagement surprise, you can always ask about that another time. It's pretty funny) and then December hit. It became real, I wanted it, and I wanted to marry this man. I became anxious and nervous and kept asking when he was going to do it, I HATE surprises. So for the first time ever I asked if he would come to Christmas Eve at my Mom's side of the family, I have never asked any boy to come to it. That family gathering is extremely personal for me.  
</p>
	<p>
He proposed to me in front of my entire family in front of my Aunt's and Uncle's gorgeous huge Christmas tree, of course I said yes! You must watch the video, the uncle commentary is the best part. I almost ruined this engagement also, something about a gift bag and me almost finding the engagement box, pretty funny actually. 
</p>
	<p>My ring was beautifully tucked away in a TARDIS, The Doctor's time machine, with an inscription "For the girl who waited, you've waited long enough".Perfection.
</p>
	<p>
	  Throughout the wedding you will see pops of blue, a TARDIS here and there bow ties and the phrase "Geronimo", this is a famous saying of Martin's most favorite Doctor, and we couldn't agree more that this word best fits our adventure together. These are our little accents that incorporate our love for the show Doctor Who. Our engagement photos also have pictures of us playing with my ring box, the TARDIS. This is truly a significant symbol for our love of each other. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  We thank you for supporting us in everything that we have done and will do. We cannot wait to see you at the wedding!! GERONIMO!!!!
